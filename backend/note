timestamp to know data updated or not, or updating.
every 1pm resets status, since all options finish trading,
maybe not the major indices...
and automatically perform update at a given time.
maybe have a python function wait 10 mins to see if its after 1pm,
and thread it, so it doesnt idle for 10 mins..

then, the data gathering part is good ^^^^^


next is getting data, is simply sql to python to frontend.
maybe from sql to python part is easy,
we need some extra formulas or calculations between python to frontend,
and feed the data to frontend.

das about it.?
